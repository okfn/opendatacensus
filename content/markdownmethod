# Methodology

This page explains the methodology behind the 2016/2017 Global Open Data Index. If you have any further questions or comments about our methodology, please reach to us through the [Open Data Index forum](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/open-data-index/global-open-data-index-2016).

The Global Open Data Index (GODI) is an independent assessment of open government data publication from a civic perspective. GODI enables different open data stakeholders to track government’s progress on open data release. GODI also allows governments to get direct feedback from data users. The Index gives both parties a baseline for discussion and analysis of the open data ecosystem in their country and internationally. We encourage all interested parties to participate in an open dialogue to allow for ownership of the results and to make the Index as relevant as possible.

## Research scope
Like any other benchmarking tool, GODI tries to answer a question. In our case, the question is as follows:
> How do governments around the world publish open data?

From this question, other important questions emerge, such as:
* Which governments readily publish open data? Which governments still need to improve open data publication?
* What is the most open dataset? What is the least open dataset?
* Which aspects of open data are easiest or hardest to implement?

In this year’s edition, we also experimented and measured aspects of “practical openness” like data findability. These are also acknowledged by the [International Open Data Charter Principles two to four](http://opendatacharter.net/principles/). The information we gained from this assessment is displayed in the results and will be available to download. It will also inform internal research which can be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/okfn/opendatasurvey)

### What GODI does NOT cover?
GODI intentionally limits its inquiry to the publication of national government data. It does not look at other aspects of the common open data assessment framework such as context, use or impact. This narrow focus enables it to provide a standardised, robust, comparable assessment of open data around the world. While we are only looking at publication, we are yet to cover data quality which is a significant barrier to reuse. We hope we will be able to do this in the future.

## Research assumptions
This section presents the key assumptions that were taken into consideration while collecting and assessing the data.

#### Assumption 1: Open data is defined by the Open Definition.
We define open data according to the [‘Open Definition’](http://opendefinition.org/). The Open Definition is a set of principles that define openness of data and content. It is also simple and easy to operationalise.
We note one small deviation from the current v2.1 of the Open Definition. The only part of our methodology that is not aligned with the Open Definition is our assessment of ‘open, machine-readable’ formats. **We give a full score to machine-readable formats even if their source code is not open.** Instead, formats must be usable with at least one free and open source software. Thereby the Index gives preference to practical openness over the actual openness of a format.

#### Assumption 2: The role of government in publishing data.
In the past, there have been questions about the role government should play to ensure the publication of open data (INSERT LINK TO DISCUSS). Government services may be privatised, which means the data can be owned and produced by a company and not the state. We assume that for the key data categories we survey, the government has a responsibility to ensure their publication, even if it is held and managed by a third-party.
#### Assumption 3: The Global Open Data Index is a ‘national’ indicator.
We acknowledge that not all countries have the same political structure. It is possible that not all of the sub-national governments produce the same data as they are potentially subject to different laws and procedures. GODI, therefore, does not only assess data publication of national government but data publication at the national level. “National” publication of open data can take three forms:
* The data describes national government processes or procedures (government entities operating on the highest administrative level).
* The data is collected or produced by national government or a national government agency (on highest administrative level).
* The data describes national parameters and public services for the entire national territory but is collected by sub-national actors.
For example, we check if budgets are available for the national government of a federal state, or if air quality data exists for all country regions. **Only in cases where we see legal and administrative autonomy from a higher government, GODI will look into sub-national territories individually** (see assumption 4).

#### Assumption 4: GODI assesses ‘places’ instead of ‘countries’.
GODI seeks to be a **meaningful and actionable indicator for government**. Therefore, GODI 2016 ranks ‘Places’ and not ‘Countries’.
For years GODI struggled to assess countries with devolved power. In some cases, such as Northern Ireland, sub-national governments mainly operate autonomously from the higher national government and are granted administrative and legislative autonomy.  To be a relevant indicator, we experimented how to better assess data on a sub-national level in a comparable way. As a test case, the Index assesses Northern Ireland separately from Great Britain this year. By separating Northern Ireland, we seek to address those government bodies that are actually responsible for publishing open data, and open up the debate how to understand open data on a subnational level. A short explanation why we regard Northern Ireland separately can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bP5nZdEgtgfM36ShmE-r9RWsnWTyAx6c-d_eDKk_zuU/edit#). We would love to hear your feedback in the discuss.okfn.org forum.
Furthermore, the British Crown Dependencies (Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey) are regarded individually because they are not part of the UK government and operate largely autonomously. In other cases, we receive submissions for places that are not officially recognised as independent countries (such as Kosovo).

## What data does the Index look at?
GODI measures the openness of clearly defined data categories. Any open data that does not fall within these categories is **not regarded** for our assessment.  All Index scores exclusively refer to our data categories and should be understood as **a proxy for the availability of open government data at large**.
This has three reasons. Firstly, **GODI assesses open government data that has proven to be useful for the public**. User stories helped us to define categories that are most useful for the public. Secondly, **GODI is a comparative indicator**. In the past, we have used broader categories and compared very different datasets, at the expense of comparability. Thirdly, a **standardised procedure supports our researchers to reduce bias and personal judgement**.

Each data category contains the following information:
* **A minimum of 3 characteristics:** The data characteristics describe the mandatory content of a dataset. Usually, all data characteristics are required to qualify for assessment.  *Usually if a dataset is missing one of the characteristics, it will be considered that the dataset is not published.*
For two categories - water quality and draft legislation we have lowered the bar by making some characteristics optional. This is because we are trying to understand better what data is out there and to improve definitions for these datasets in the future.
* **Aggregation level:** Some data is available in different levels of aggregation. For example, water quality data can exist for each individual water source, or it can be presented as total annual pollution for regions or the country. *In most cases GODI assesses detailed, disaggregated data.*
Comprehensive data increases the use cases and broadens the insights people can draw from it. [The International Open Data Charter](http://opendatacharter.net/) also emphasises that the data should be published in its raw, original format as disaggregated data. Being clear about the aggregation level helps to guide our researchers looking for the correct dataset.
* **Time intervals:** Different datasets are updated in different time intervals. Our survey includes the question “This data should be updated every [TIME INTERVAL]. Is it up-to-date?” to assess whether data is up-to-date. Data that is not up-to-date often is less useful.

Governments often publish data on multiple websites, and in many files and formats. To make an informed and consistent decision about which data to pick, reviewers followed two approaches:

1. **Choosing one reference dataset:** Reviewers find one reference dataset or file that contains all relevant characteristics. They answer the survey using this dataset. This can be a CSV file, a shapefile, or data presented on a website. If reviewers have to choose between two or more similar datasets, they should choose the one that scores highest and document their choice in a comment.
2. **Referencing multiple datasets (if one reference file is not available):** Reviewers could not find a reference dataset because the data is split across many files, formats and places. In this case, they refer the survey to different files. It is important that the sum of these files contains all required data characteristics. Example: if one dataset displays vote on bills and are in a machine-readable format, but another one contains bill texts and is not machine-readable, then the data is not considered to be machine-readable.

## The list of data categories
Our data categories reflect key data that is relevant for civil society at large. The categories have been developed in partnership with domain experts, including organisations championing open data in their respective fields. In some cases, we base our definition on international data production and reporting standards used by governments around the world. Each year we refine our definitions to reflect learnings from these experts.

## Survey questions and scoring
Each dataset in each place is evaluated using a set of questions that examine the openness of the datasets based on the Open Definition and the Open Data Charter. In 2016, we introduced a new survey. The new scoring follows three ideas:
* Each survey question measures a crucial aspect of either the legal, technical, or practical ‘openness’ of data. With this approach, we aim to reduce the potential bias towards single aspects of openness.
* Our scoring follows a rationale in which we describe why a question is important for open data. We also explain cases why we should not score a question. Further explanations can be found in the table below or here.
* The new scoring gives in total 40 points to open licenses/public domain status and machine-readable and open file formats. These technical and legal aspects of openness are the core of the Open Definition 2.1, and we seek to maintain a strong emphasis on them. However, aspects such timely publication, data availability and accessibility are equally important to access and use open data. Questions around data accessibility receive a score of in total 60 points.

## How to ‘read’ the final results
As explained in the sections above, the Index looks at specific data using specific survey questions. The result is a final score that has to be read carefully. Firstly, it exclusively refers to data with mandatory characteristics. If no dataset can be found online matching these characteristics, the data will not be considered to be available (equalling a score of 0%). More explanations to this approach can be found in the section “What data does the Index look at?”.
Furthermore, the survey questions check different aspects of data access and usability (see table below). This means that behind fairly high scores we often do not find open data, but access-controlled data, or public data in poorly structured, or not machine-readable formats. The score, therefore, does not show a linear increase of openness. Instead, it highlights areas where the government may improve open data publication.
An example: We may assess budget data in PDF form which may be in public domain, available online for free, but in a format making it practically unusable. This data is presented as 80% open. The score suggests a fairly high degree of openness, but in fact, the data is not open. Only 100% means that the data is open.
The reason for this is that we do not add many filters, such as exclusively considering data that is machine-readable - even though it might give a more realistic image of open data. With this approach, the Index seeks to demonstrate which data is already available and how it can be further improved. It is, therefore, important to carefully read how the data is published.

Depending on what survey items are checked, we find:

##Our data collection and analysis

The data collection of  the Index is done in three terms:

1. Submission phase using a snowball sampling approach. It includes an interim phase to filter out countries that do not have submissions for all data.

2. Review phase of one month

3. Quality assurance of review results

###Submission phase
The Index crowdsources its data. To do so, it uses a [non-probability sampling technique](https://www.thoughtco.com/sampling-designs-used-in-sociology-3026562) — also known as a “snowball sample”. A snowball sample attempts to locate the subject of studies in areas that are hard to locate. In our case, we work with contributors who are interested in open government data and who can assess the availability and quality of open datasets in their respective locations. We do so not only by using referrals, but also by reaching out on social media, through regular communications our Open Government Data and [Open Data Index forums](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/open-data-index/global-open-data-index-2015), and by actively networking at conferences and events. This year, like in 2015, we also hired local coordinators, that outreached to their networks and assist in soliciting new submissions.
This means that anyone from any place can participate and contribute to the Global Open Data Index as a contributor and make submissions, which are then reviewed. We do not have a quota on the number of places that can participate. Rather, we aim to sample as many places around the world as we can. This year, we considered only places that had submissions to all 15 categories. Places that had partial submissions were omitted. Data findability also has an impact on the quality of the data we collect. Contributors have diverse knowledge and backgrounds in open data and sometimes need help finding the data we are looking for. The following section explains how we tried to deal with this problem.

###Review process
To provide reliable and valid results, each submission must be reviewed again. Our reviewers are domain experts. A list of all reviewers can be found on the About page. In the past, the review was country-based. We engaged local reviewers to verify all submissions for a country. It allowed us to overcome language problems and evaluate submissions in the context of a country. This approach, however, led to inconsistencies. Across countries, submitters evaluated datasets with sometimes very different content. This went so far that submitters evaluated the openness of data that was so highly aggregated that it was not usable. Since 2015 we, therefore, use a **thematic review**. Each reviewer gets assigned one data category and checks the submissions across all places. A thematic review has further advantages: (1) Reviewers develop a consistent approach how to assess data categories. (2) They develop a sense where a similar piece of data can usually be found. (3) They can collect information in which formats and quality specific data are provided. This information is used by us to refine our data categories and guidance for future editions. To do so, we document our findings in review diaries.

####Review Diaries
The reviewers document in diaries all problems they encountered during the review, as well as proposals to improve the Index. What was hard to assess? How can data categories be improved? Review diaries are especially useful to understand how reviewers dealt with edge cases. In what cases did they have to use their personal judgement? Thereby we want to ensure the highest degree of transparency possible, so others understand the steps that were taken to verify a submission. Also as advocates for open science, we wish to enable others to learn from our efforts and to improve their own research. Further information is shared on our insights page. A list of review diaries can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5j55T4ZyssBUTlRbkdvYzhOSkU).

###Quality assurance of review
This year we did a quality assurance of the review results. Once the review results were gathered, Open Knowledge International staff members analysed all data sets scoring 100% to verify whether they were correctly assessed and to spot false negatives

* We only focussed on the top scoring data for the following reasons:
100% scoring data has an important signalling function to the government suggesting that data is fully open.
* Eliminating mistakes in 100% scoring data presents a realistic picture to the government. It is hard to justify why a dataset, once falsely deemed open, shall not be 100% open in following years.

The quality assurance was accomplished in the following steps:
1. Checking the forum for comments from our community.
2. Compare with results from last year. Are the same source URLs used? Is something different this year? If so, why?
3. Go to the source URL and double-check all survey questions.
4. Look at the reviewer comments: Do reviewers say that the assessed data does not meet all characteristics? Does the submission maybe even have to be rejected?
5. Check if an open license clearly refers to the reference dataset. Check it especially in cases where an open license was found on another website, than on the one were data is hosted. Also, check if the license terms comply with the Open Definition.
6. We looked into 2015 GODI results to see what changed. A frequent case: Do our reviewers refer to a different website or data portal?

The quality assurance phase showed us that some reviews contained some errors, which were discussed and corrected with the reviewers. We documented the findings of the quality assurance, as well as our learnings from it.

## Public dialogue phase
Once our results are published, we invite civil society and government to provide us with feedback about what they find useful (or not) and to tell us how they think we could strengthen the assessment. This dialogue phase will be open for one month, after which we will publish the revised data by June.
In the past, we got approached by governments and civil society alike to discuss our results. Reformers and open data decision-makers reference our data and publicly highlight their advancement in the Index - and civil society provides constructive feedback about their country context so we can improve the assessment. This feedback is very useful for our team. But for the Index to be most effective, these points should be discussed in an open dialogue, so civil society and government can talk to one another, learn from one another, and take ownership to improve open data publication.
Convening data providers and users is a unique and important quality of the Index. Research by Open Knowledge International and others ([here](http://civicus.org/thedatashift/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-evidence-to-action.pdf ) and [here](http://aiddata.org/governance-data-who-uses-it-and-why)) suggests that indicators must be relevant for users, actionable, resonate with the users’ priorities, and credible and robust. We are aware that striking the right balance is challenging: we need to ground the Index in the realities and priorities of governments so they can improve their scores, while at the same time highlighting data demands of civil society. Through open dialogue, we want to know whether the Index is useful for both parties, want to see how open data supply and demand can match, and stimulate more constructive uptake to improve open data publication at country level.
