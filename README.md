================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/okfn/opendatacensus.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/okfn/opendatacensus)

Website for the [Open Data Census][] including submission workflow,
presentation of results and visualizations.

This also includes various ancillary information providing an overview of what
is happening with release of open government data around the world (and
initiatives related to it).

How it works technically
-------------------------

Census is being performed at 2 different levels:

* Country level
* City / regional level

The set of datasets asked about for each level are different but the questions asked per dataset are very similar.

We use google spreadsheets as a backend for the Open Data Census. Data is stored in 3 different spreadsheets:

* [Dataset and Questions spreadsheet][questions] - this list the datasets for
  the country census as well as the questions asked for each dataset
* [Country spreadsheet][country]

[questions]: https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aon3JiuouxLUdEVHQ0c4RGlRWm9Gak54NGV0UlpfOGc#gid=0
[country]: https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aon3JiuouxLUdEVnbG5pUFlyUzBpVkFXbXJ2WWpGTUE#gid=6

For historical reasons the raw data from the Country and City census arrive in different forms. We aim to get

We attempt to have a common form to the results spreadsheet.

1. Submissions - this is raw data from form submissions
2. Normalized - raw submissions data but in normalized form (standard headings)
3. Reviewed (not yet used) - reviewed and consolidated data

Process

1. Submit via google form
2. Arrive in submissions tab
3. Copy to the Normalized tab (which has standard columns)
4. Review (soon)

For Developers
--------------

The app is a simple Express NodeJS app designed to be deployed on Heroku.

We have 2 main branches:

* master - development branch - deploy to <http://opendatacensus-staging.herokuapp.com/>
* production - release branch (production ready code) - deploy to <http://census.okfn.org/>

### Install

To install do the following:

1. Get the code and init the submodules (for recline vendor library)

        git clone https://github.com/okfn/opendatacensus
        git submodule init
        git submodule update

2. Install node dependencies

        cd opendatacensus
        npm install .

3. Run the app

        node app.js

4. Should now be running at <http://localhost:5000>


### Configuration

Configuration runs off lib/config.js. You can selectively override in your own
local config. To do this:

* Create `settings.json`
* Copy the config object from lib/config.js and override relevant parts. Note
  you don't need the whole object only the bits you want to change. For example:

        {
          "google": {
            "user": "xxx",
            "password": "yyy"
          }
        }

Note for Heroku you could try uploading a settings.json or take a look at
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars

### Running Tests

Install mocha (see devDependencies in package.json) then do:

    mocha tests/

**note** we run off live data yet some expected values are hard-coded. Thus
tests are likely to break as underlying data changes. We should fix this soon
by running off mock data.

### Deployment

We have 2 apps on Heroku:

* Production: `opendatacensus` - push there from production branch
* Staging: `opendatacensus-staging` - push from master

To work with a given remote:

    heroku --remote production ...

To work with these do:

    heroku git:remote -r production -a opendatacensus
    heroku git:remote -r staging -a opendatacensus-staging
    # this way git push heroku master will push to staging
    heroku git:remote -a opendatacensus-staging

To avoid error suggest making the staging app the default:

    git config heroku.remote staging
