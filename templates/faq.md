<h2 id="about">About the Open Data Census</h2>

### What's the current state of the Open Data Census?

Right now we are collecting data for the **2013** Census, which focusses on country-level information.  We will be launching the 2013 Census results later in Septmber/October 2013.

After that we will be looking at developing a city-level Census and other enhancements.

**Most of the information in this FAQ applies to the 2013 Census - 2012 ran a little differently.**

### What is the Open Data Census?

The Open Data Census is a year-round ongoing measure of the current state of the open data world; annual snapshots are made by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org) to showcase the results (the first one later in autumn 2013).  Anyone can contribute at any time to have their input peer-reviewed periodically by a team of 60+ Country Editors.


### Who created the Open Data Census?

The purpose of the Census is to provide an accurate and reliable assessment of the state of open (government) data around the world and to present this information in a way that is easy to understand and use.

The Open Data Census was initiated by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org). It is maintained by the Foundation and its [Open Government Data working group](http://opengovernmentdata.org/) with contributions from many members of the wider community.

### What is the history of the Open Data Census?

The Census was created by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org) in 2012, and provides a clear measure of available open data - not what is claimed, but what data is actually available and how open it is. The Census is designed by open data experts, including the [Open Knowledge Foundation Open Government Working Group](http://opengovernmentdata.org/), and undergoes a process of peer review and evidence checking to ensure high quality results. An annual announcement of the results creates a focus for debate and review. The Census was launched in 2012 and is undergoing active development to create an Open Data Index in September/October 2013.

### What datasets are included in the Country Census?

There are 10 datasets considered in the 2013 Census:

{{datasets}}


### How reliable is the Open Data Census?

The information in the Census is collected by open data experts around the world including the [Open Knowledge Foundation Open Government Working Group](http://opengovernmentdata.org/). The Census data undergoes a process of peer review and evidence checking to ensure high quality results.


### What about the City Census?

We are currently expanding and improving the Open Data Census and are currently focusing on the Country Census. The City Census is still running on the older system and is due for update later. This means City Census results are not currently being reviewed. More detailed plans for the update will be announced shortly.

### What about the 2012 Census?

Right now we're focussed on the 2013 Census and so the information on the site and in this FAQ mostly is about 2013. In 2012 we looked at fewer datasets and some of the details of methodology were a little different.


<h2 id="submit">Submitting information to the Census</h2>

At the moment we are only working on 2013 information.

The census is a survey of the state of open data around the world focusing on the the availability and openness of a <a href=”http://2013.census.okfn.org/about/”>specific set of key datasets</a>.


### What's the Open Data Census data collection and review process?

It works like this:

1. Contributors submit information about the availability (or not) of key datasets in their country (for example Budgets in Brasil)

2. These Submissions are reviewed by a Reviewer before they are posted live on the website.

3. Reviewers either approve (with or without amendments) or reject the Submission

4. If approved, these Submissions become an official entry in the census and are displayed on the website.



### How can I improve the Census information about a country?

If you've got information about a dataset which isn't in the Census yet you can add it!  Anyone can submit new information to the Census.

* Select your country in [the list](http://2013.census.okfn.org/contribute/) and click on it.
* You are now on the Country overview page for that country
* Click the blue “Submit Information” button on the right next to the appropriate category.
* Fill the form based on the data set you have found (there are detailed instructions on the page).
* Click Submit. Your submission is now waiting for review, and will be visible in the table as 'awaiting review' after a few minutes.

### How can I correct an existing entry in the Census?

We welcome corrections to the Census :)  Anyone can submit corrections to the Census.

* Select your country in [the list](http://2013.census.okfn.org/contribute/) and click on it.
* Go to the correct country by clicking it.
* On the Country overview page, click the blue “Submit Information” button on the right next to the appropriate category.
* Fill in the form based on the changes you want to make to the existing data.
* Click Submit. Your submission is now waiting for review, and will be visible in the table as 'awaiting review' after a few minutes.

### What do all the questions about the data sets mean?

When filling in information about a dataset, there's a list of questions to answer about the availability and openness of the datasets.  The answers then appear in the country overview page for the Census.

{{questions}}

### Questions about the assessment of openness

#### Are data to be considered publicly available if an FOI request is needed to retrieve them?

By publicly available is meant without having to put in FOI request - so it should be available without further ado.

#### What about countries where there is no official Open License or Open Government Data License in their legislation?

Data can only be marked as "openly licensed" if an open licence has been applied to it. [Open Licences](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/) which meet the requirements of [the Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/) are [listed here](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/).

### What should I do if different regions/counties/municipalities have different open data situations?

Please email the [Open Data Census discussion list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-data-census) and explain the situation and we'll figure out how to handle the situation. This FAQ will be updated with more info soon!

### How are different years handled?

Right now we are collecting information for the state of open data in the world in 2013, and this data is collected at [http://2013.census.okfn.org](http://2013.census.okfn.org).

The [main Census page](http://census.okfn.org) points to the current year's census and soon you'll be able to see all the various years of Census results and in the future you'll be able to compare them too.

### I want to help but I'm not sure where to start!

On the Open Data Census, you can see the 10 categories of data that we are focusing on on [the actual site](http://2013.census.okfn.org/country/). Each of the entries for each country has been sent in by citizens of that country, who have simply used Google or other search engines to find out what data sets are available (simply finding the URL) and under which circumstances (are the data openly licensed, can they be downloaded in bulk etc.) - and then made a submission via the form on the site, where they simply fill out a handful of questions and put in the URL for the data. All in all it is a really easy (and fun) task that helps to put a country on the open data map - and it's easy to get started!

You can do some research yourself! Pick a country where the Census shows there is data missing or where there are comments showing that there's uncertainty (perhaps the licence hasn't been specified for example) or a country that you know well.

A targetted search or working with others is most fun and helpful. You could ask on  the [Open Data Census discussion list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-data-census) whether there's a country or area you could help with. Get together with friends, colleagues, your local open data community or [Open Knowledge Foundation local group](http://okfn.org/local) and dig into data on a given topic or for a given country together.

### How can I get more involved?

If you'd like to be more involved you could become a Country Editor for the Census.  Only Census Country Editors can review submissions. If you’d like to become an editor, email the Census team on census@okfn.org

If there's already an editor for the country you are interested in, don't worry - it's great to have more than one editor as you can work together!  More eyes on the data makes the data better quality.


### Where can I discuss the Open Data Census with others?

Join the [Open Data Census discussion list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-data-census)

### I'm confused! How can I get help?

There are lots of people who can help on the [Open Data Census discussion list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-data-census) and there are no silly questions, so we encourage you to post there.  You can also privately email the Census Team at the Open Knowledge Foundation on census@okfn.org


<h2 id="results">Understanding the Open Data Census results</h2>

### 2012 versus 2013

You can see the results for the 2012 Census online now, but for the final 2013 results you'll need to wait for our current round of data collection and peer review to finish. We'll be launching 2013 later this autumn... watch this space!

In the meantime you can see the [results in progress for the 2013 Census](http://2013.census.okfn.org/country/) - if these don't look right for your country, [correct them](http://2013.census.okfn.org/contribute/)!

<h3 id="scoring">How does the scoring system work?</h3>

The Open Data Census measures the state of openness of 10 data sets for each country. The overall score for a dataset is based on the response to specific questions with varying weightings - the weighting for each question is listed in the question table above. The overall country score is then calculated from the score on each dataset.
